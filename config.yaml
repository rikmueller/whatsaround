overpass:
  # Number of retry attempts for failed Overpass API requests

  # Distance in km of track to query per Overpass API call
  # Batching reduces API calls: e.g., 100km route with batch_km=50 = 2 queries instead of 30+
  # Lower values for complex queries or dense areas, higher for simple queries
  # Recommended: 30-60km (default: 50km)
